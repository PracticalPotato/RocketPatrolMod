Rocket Patrol Mod

Partially at the recommendation of a groupmate, I've selected 

[DONE] Add your own (copyright-free) background music to the Play scene (10)
            The song I wanted to use was copyrighted under CC BY-SA 4.0, so I provided credit below.
[DONE] Allow the player to control the Rocket after it's fired (10)
[DONE] Implement Parallax Scrolling (15)
            The background and spaceships move at different speeds, relative to the movement of the player.
            However, it still feels really weird to play. Not sure if I got my values wrong or
            whether it's just the jerkiness of the player's movement making it seem like the ships
            are speeding and slowing down erratically
[DONE] Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (15)
[DONE] Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (25)
            Implemented with a new sprite and a speed multiplier variable
[DONE] Implement a new timing/scoring mechanism that adds time to the clock for successful hits (25)
            The time pauses for an amount of time dependent on the point value of the ship hit.
