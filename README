Rocket Patrol Mod

At the recommendation of a groupmate, I've selected 

[DONE] Add your own (copyright-free) background music to the Play scene (10)
[DONE] Allow the player to control the Rocket after it's fired (10)
  Create a new title screen (15)
[DONE] Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (15)
  Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (25)
[DONE] Implement a new timing/scoring mechanism that adds time to the clock for successful hits (25)
            The time pauses for an amount of time dependent on the point value of the ship hit.
