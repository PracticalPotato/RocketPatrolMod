Rocket Patrol Mod

At the recommendation of a groupmate, I've selected 

Add your own (copyright-free) background music to the Play scene (10)
Allow the player to control the Rocket after it's fired (10
Create a new title screen (15)
Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (15)
Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (25)
Implement a new timing/scoring mechanism that adds time to the clock for successful hits (25)

note to self: python -m http.server 8000
